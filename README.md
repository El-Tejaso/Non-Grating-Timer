# Non-grating timer
I have an hourglass timer on my phone. But the ringing hurts my ears, gives me tinnitus, and makes everyone within 1km's ears bleed. Ok maybe not the last part. But it isn't very pleasant. Not to mention that it is startling, but this would also apply to any other timer that uses a loud sound as the mechanism for telling you that the time is up.

And every sound you could possibly use will either be un-noticeable, or annoying after a while.

## Ok, so what's so great about your timer then?

It is a win-forms program that will become one of those "Always on top" windows once the countdown ends. It will also be bouncing around the screen like one of those DVD icons on those old TVs (think that one episode of The Office) untill you click on it. This is because simply moving to the top wasn't enough for me to notice it, and I had to add 1 more thing to it. This timer won't startle you, or annoy the people around you in the process (it will annoy you a little though. Especially if you didn't read this readme and know that you can just click on the window to stop it from moving around).
It also works if you're deaf or if your computer's speakers are broken.

To use, build the program using C# and Visual Studio 2022. Or just download the binary from the release section.
