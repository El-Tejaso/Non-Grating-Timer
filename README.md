# Non-grating timer
I have an hourglass timer on my phone. But the ringing hurts my ears, gives me tinnitus, and makes everyone within 1km's ears bleed. Ok maybe not the last part. But it isn't very pleasant. Not to mention that it is startling, but this would also apply to any other timer that uses sound as the mechanism for telling you that the time is up.

## Ok, so what's so great about your timer then?

It is a win-forms program that will become one of those "Always on top" windows once the countdown ends. This should force you to see it, and hopefully it won't startle/annoy you or the people around you in the process.

To use, build the program using C# and Visual Studio 2022. Or just download the binary from the release section
